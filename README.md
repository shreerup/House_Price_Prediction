# House_Price_Prediction
This model predicts the price of a house based upon certain features.
Firstly, the model is built using sklearn and linear regression using banglore home prices dataset from kaggle.com.
Then, a python flask server is written that uses the saved model to serve http requests.
Also, a website is built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript that allows user to enter the sqft area, no. of bedrooms, location etc. and it will call python flask server to retrieve the predicted price.
